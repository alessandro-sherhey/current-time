# current-time
Hi everyone! This is my first project where I used JavaScript. I used it for modifying the DOM (Document Object Model), in other words the content of the page, and for getting the time. I decided to make this because I thought it would be a fun thing to make (indeed it was) and to practice JavaScript.

## Features
- **Shows the time** *(incredible)*
- Choose between **3 time formats**, **3 fonts** and **3 sizes**
- **English** and **Italian** language
- **Dark theme**
- **Hide the toolbar button** by **pressing the spacebar**
- *Reduced font size for mobiles (50%)*

**Right now the "Dark Mode" just indicates if dark mode is enabled or not**, but I'll transform it into an actual dark/light mode switch in the future!
