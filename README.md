# current-time

Hi everyone! This is my first project where I used JavaScript. I used it for modifying the DOM (Document Object Model), in other words the content of the page, and for getting the time. In the bottom there is a button. That opens the toolbar. There you'll find some options for changing the time format, font, size and other things.

**Right now the "Dark Mode" just indicates if dark mode is enabled or not**, but I'll transform it into an actual dark/light mode switch in the future! 

*(small thing: you can press the spacebar to hide the "show tools" button)*
